## Create Client Executable

Run the command line command `make dist-cli` to create the executable. It will create `dist/teller`. You can move this into your current directory, put it in a PATH directory, or add it directly to your PATH.

## Create Instrument

First you will need to create an instrument to use.

`teller create instrument_type currency_code precision use_identity_oracle enforcement_orders_permitted`

The command line should display a response showing the transaction ID and instrument details.
